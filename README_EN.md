## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

**MyCinemaList** is a platform designed for true film lovers who want a complete and personalized experience when organizing and sharing their opinions on films. Here, the user not only manages lists of movies with notes and viewing statuses, but also creates reviews with detailed recommendations, and can express positive, negative or mixed feelings.

The platform also allows users to create and personalize their profiles, follow their favourite people and films and explore the profiles of other users, actors, directors and other people who take part in the films. To ensure good content management, there is a robust administration panel where administrators have full control over movies, people and reviews.

In MyCinemaList, the evaluation of films is transparent and social: any user can see the average score and the percentage of recommendations, giving a clear and communal view of what each title is worth.
